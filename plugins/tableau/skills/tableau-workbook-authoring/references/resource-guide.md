# Resource Guide

Detailed reference for `../../scripts/tableau_resources.py`. Read this when
the quick reference in SKILL.md is not enough — full flag lists, mapping
syntax, worked examples, and how to recover from each failure mode.

Every command below repeats the same path used in SKILL.md,
`../../scripts/tableau_resources.py`. That path is relative to **this
skill's own directory** (`skills/tableau-workbook-authoring/`, where
SKILL.md lives) — not to this `references/` file, which sits one level
deeper. Resolve the script to an absolute path once, from the skill
directory, before running any command that changes your working
directory; do not re-derive the relative path from wherever your shell
happens to be.

## Catalog shape

Every entry in `resources/catalog.json` has:

- `id` — stable identifier, e.g. `insights__bar_chart`.
- `type` — `template`, `example`, `reference`, or `starter`.
- `tier` — `executable` (renderable via `instantiate`/`inject`) or
  `reference` (inspiration only — corpus entries, worked examples, schema
  docs). Passing a `reference`-tier id to `instantiate`/`inject` fails
  closed with "is reference-only and cannot be rendered".
- `family` — grouping such as `pulse-insights`, `magnitude`,
  `change-over-time`, `distribution`, `ranking`, `deviation`, `correlation`,
  `flow`, `part-to-whole`, `spatial`, or `null` for ungrouped resources.
- `datasources` — the donor datasource name(s) a template's bookmark
  references. `instantiate`/`inject` renders against a single donor.
- `fields` — the donor fields a template places on a shelf
  (`sourceField`, `role`, `derivation`, `shelf`). These are the field
  mappings `--map` must satisfy.
- `parameters` — typed contracts (`date`, `enum`, `number`, `string`) for
  every `{{PARAMETER}}` token the bookmark declares. `--param` must satisfy
  every `required: true` entry.

## `list` — discover before choosing

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/tableau_resources.py list \
  --query "rank products by revenue" \
  --family pulse-insights \
  --type template \
  --tier executable \
  --format text
```

All filters are optional and exact-match except `--query`, which tokenizes
and matches against id, intent, family, and keywords. Omit `--tier` to see
reference material too, but never pass a reference-tier id to a transform
command.

## `inspect` — read the contract before mapping

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/tableau_resources.py inspect insights__bar_chart --format text
```

Returns the full catalog entry: donor datasource, every source field with
its shelf/role/derivation/datatype, and every parameter's type (and `allowed`
values for `enum`). Use this output to build the `--map` and `--param`
arguments — never invent a field name or parameter value from memory.

## Datatype compatibility

A `--map` may only point a source field at a target field in the same
datatype family:

| Family | Tableau datatypes |
| --- | --- |
| numeric | `integer`, `real` |
| temporal | `date`, `datetime` |
| string | `string` |
| boolean | `boolean` |
| spatial | `spatial` |

Within a family the template survives being repointed — the derivation, the
shelf role, and the mark type stay valid — so only the declared type changes.
Across a family boundary it does not, so the mapping is refused before
anything is written. The datatype each source field expects is the last item
in `inspect`'s `fields` list.

The rendered worksheet declares each mapped field with the *target's* own
datatype and role, read from the target datasource's `<column>` declaration
or, when it has none, from its `<metadata-record>` entry. A target field
whose datatype cannot be determined from either is refused rather than
guessed.

## `--map` / `--param` syntax

Both flags are repeatable — pass one per field or parameter:

```bash
--map SOURCE=TARGET --map "Close Date"="Order Date" --param NAME=VALUE
```

- Each occurrence is exactly one `NAME=VALUE` pair, split on the *first*
  `=` (so a value containing its own `=` is fine).
- Leading/trailing whitespace around both `NAME` and `VALUE` is stripped.
- Neither `NAME` nor `VALUE` may be blank after stripping.
- The same `NAME` cannot appear twice across repeated `--map` (or
  `--param`) flags — a duplicate name fails closed rather than silently
  keeping the last value.

## `instantiate` — new workbook from the starter

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/tableau_resources.py instantiate insights__bar_chart \
  --datasource-definition ./my-datasource.xml \
  --output ./workbook.twb \
  --worksheet-name "ARR by Product" \
  --map ARR=Revenue \
  --map "Close Date"="Order Date" \
  --map Product=Product \
  --param DATE_MIN=2024-01-01 \
  --param DATE_MAX=2024-12-31 \
  --param DIRECTION=DESC
```

- `--datasource-definition` must be a file containing exactly one
  `<datasource>` element with a nonempty `name` attribute; that name becomes
  the workbook's target datasource.
- `--map SOURCE=TARGET` maps one donor field (from `inspect`'s `fields`) to
  a field name in your datasource. Supply one `--map` per required field;
  an unknown or missing mapping fails closed.
- `--param NAME=VALUE` supplies one declared parameter. Dates must be
  ISO-8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`); enums must be one of the `allowed` values.
- Validation for `instantiate` runs against the *clean bundled starter* as
  its baseline. The starter has no pre-existing errors, so there is
  nothing to tolerate: every error in the output is your responsibility.
  This is not a delta check (see `inject`, below) — it behaves like an
  absolute check because the baseline is always clean.

## `inject` — add to an existing workbook

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/tableau_resources.py inject insights__line_chart \
  --input ./workbook.twb \
  --output ./workbook-with-trend.twb \
  --datasource "Sample - Superstore" \
  --worksheet-name "ARR Trend" \
  --map ARR=ARR \
  --map "Close Date"="Close Date"
```

- `--output` is a **distinct path** here on purpose: a failed run never
  touches the input workbook. Writing back to the same path as `--input`
  is a deliberate, explicit exception — it requires `--overwrite` so that
  in-place replacement is opt-in rather than the default, e.g.
  `--output ./workbook.twb --overwrite`.
- `--datasource` is the *internal* `name` attribute of a `<datasource>`
  element in the input workbook's own `<datasources>` container — not
  necessarily its on-screen caption. Open the workbook's XML to confirm
  the name if you are unsure. A name the workbook does not have fails
  closed: `Workbook has no datasource named <name> (available: <name,
  name, ...>)`, so you can retry with a value from that list instead of
  guessing.
- Validation for `inject` is a **delta** against the input workbook's own
  pre-existing errors: an inherited error (for example a hidden sheet with
  no window) does not block the run, but any *new* error the injected
  content introduces does. This delta behavior is specific to `inject`;
  the standalone `validate` command below never grants this tolerance.
- `--worksheet-name` must be unique in the workbook; a collision fails
  closed rather than silently renaming.
- Pass `--overwrite` only when you intend to replace the input file itself,
  or an existing output file.

## `validate` — read the errors, don't guess

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/tableau_resources.py validate --input ./workbook.twb
```

This standalone command is an **absolute** structural check on the whole
file you point it at: it reports every error the workbook has, with no
tolerance for pre-existing problems. (Delta tolerance is internal to
`inject`'s own pre-write check, above; `instantiate`'s check has nothing
to tolerate because its baseline is the clean bundled starter.)

- Exit code `0` with `[]` means no structural errors.
- Exit code `1` prints a JSON list of stable error codes, in this fixed
  order: `malformed-xml`, `not-tableau-workbook`, `missing-*-container`,
  `unresolved-template-token`, `unresolved-federated-placeholder`,
  `duplicate-worksheet-name: <name>`, `duplicate-window-name: <name>`,
  `worksheet-window-name-mismatch: <name>`,
  `unknown-datasource-reference: <name>`,
  `unknown-field-reference: <datasource>.<field>`.
- Exit code `2` means the command itself failed operationally, before or
  instead of producing that list — for example `--input` does not exist,
  is not readable, or is not valid UTF-8. The error text goes to stderr
  instead of stdout, and there is no JSON list to parse.

Local `validate` is not the pre-publish gate. Always follow it with the
`validate-workbook-package` skill before calling
`create-and-publish-workbook`.

## Failure recovery

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Resource <id> is reference-only and cannot be rendered` | Passed a `reference`-tier id to `instantiate`/`inject` | Use `list --tier executable` to find a renderable id, or treat the resource purely as inspiration |
| `Unknown field mappings: ...` | `--map` names a field not in the resource's `fields`/metadata list | Re-run `inspect` and map only the listed source fields |
| `Missing field mappings: ...` | A required source field has no `--map` | Add the missing `--map SOURCE=TARGET` |
| `Missing parameters: ...` / `Unknown parameters: ...` | `--param` doesn't match the resource's typed contract | Re-run `inspect` for exact names, types, and `allowed` values |
| `Parameter <name> must be an ISO-8601 date...` | Bad date format | Use `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `Datasource <name> has no field named ...` | `--map` target field doesn't exist in the workbook's/definition's datasource | Fix the datasource definition or choose an existing field |
| `Incompatible field mappings: ...` | A `--map` crosses a datatype family, or its target field declares no datatype | Map the source field to a target field of the same family (see *Datatype compatibility*), or declare the target field's `datatype` |
| `Workbook already contains a worksheet/window named <name>` | `--worksheet-name` collides with an existing one | Choose a different `--worksheet-name` |
| `Generated workbook failed validation: ...` | The transform would introduce a new structural error | Read the listed error codes; for `inject`, only *new* errors block, so check the message's "pre-existing errors" list to see what was already broken |
| `Refusing to replace existing file ...` | `--output` exists and `--overwrite` was omitted | Pass `--overwrite` or choose a different `--output` |

## Reference-only resources are inspiration, not input

Resources with `tier: reference` — worked examples in `resources/examples/`,
the corpus and schema references in `resources/references/`, and any
`reference/*.tbm` template — describe patterns to study when designing a
viz by hand. They are never valid arguments to `instantiate`/`inject`, and
the CLI enforces this: attempting to render one raises `ResourceError`
before touching any file.
