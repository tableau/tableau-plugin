# Calling external APIs from a data app

A data app runs as a sandboxed viz extension. By default it can reach nothing outside its own
package. Read this before building anything that calls a third-party API, loads a remote image,
script, or font, or embeds outside content.

## The content security policy

Tableau serves the extension with a CSP whose `default-src` is only the package's own `content/`
path. Images are allowed from the package and `data:`. Two directives are fixed and can't be
opened up:

- `frame-src 'none'`: no iframes, so no embedded players, maps, or widgets from other sites.
- `object-src 'none'`: no plugins.

Inline scripts and `eval` are allowed. `fetch()` in `no-cors` mode is still blocked by the CSP.

## Allowing an origin takes two parts

An external origin is added to every CSP source list (`default-src`, `connect-src`, `img-src`,
`script-src`, and so on) only when **both** are true:

1. **The site allows it.** A site admin lists it under Settings > Extensions > Extension Package
   Allowed Origins. `scaffold-data-app` returns this list as `allowedOrigins`. The site setting
   alone does nothing.
2. **The package requests it.** `Packages/<package id>/manifest.json` (the JSON manifest at the
   package root, not the `.trex`) declares it in `requestedOrigins`.

The `requestedOrigins` value must be **one space-separated string**:

```json
{ "requestedOrigins": "https://accounts.example.com https://api.example.com" }
```

A JSON array is silently ignored, and so is a key named `allowedOrigins`. In both cases the CSP
falls back to package-only and every external call is blocked with no error from Tableau. Don't
edit this file by hand; use `scripts/declare_origins.py`, which writes the right shape, checks
each origin against the site list, and creates the manifest from the `.trex` if it's missing.
`package_twbx.py` hard-fails on an array value.

An origin is scheme + host (+ port): `https://api.example.com`. No path, query, or trailing slash.

## Origin `null` and CORS

The extension's origin is `null`, so every external request is cross-origin. Allowlisting only
gets the request past the CSP; the API must also answer with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
(or echo `null`). APIs that only allow specific origins, or send no CORS headers, can't be called
from a data app no matter what is allowlisted. Check with:

```bash
curl -sI -X OPTIONS -H 'Origin: null' -H 'Access-Control-Request-Method: GET' https://api.example.com/<path> | grep -i access-control
```

Because there's no stable origin and pop-ups aren't available, interactive OAuth sign-in from
inside the app doesn't work. Any token has to be obtained outside the app, which raises the
issues in Security best practices in SKILL.md.

## Check the live policy

When an external call fails, find out what the CSP actually allows instead of guessing. Add this
temporarily to `app.js`, republish, and read the result on screen:

```js
document.addEventListener('securitypolicyviolation', (e) => {
  renderError(`Blocked ${e.blockedURI} by ${e.violatedDirective}. Policy: ${e.originalPolicy}`);
});
fetch('https://api.example.com/').catch((err) => renderError(`fetch failed: ${err.message}`));
```

- The origin missing from the policy means one of the two parts is missing: re-run
  `scaffold-data-app` for a fresh `allowedOrigins`, and `declare_origins.py --list` for what the
  package requests.
- The origin present in the policy but `fetch` still failing means a CORS problem on the API side.

Remove the probe before the final publish.

## Prefer not to need this

Every external origin is a dependency the site admin has to approve and a path for data to leave
Tableau. Ask whether the app really needs it before adding one; see Security best practices in
SKILL.md.
